      Instructions
    </h4>
  <ol>
    <li> Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
      You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
      the eggs evenly coat the surface.
    </li>
    <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
      middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
      fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
    </li>
  </ol>
